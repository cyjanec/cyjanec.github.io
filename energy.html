							<h2>EPICS CED - Energy</h2>
						</header>
						<p>FALL 2021 (ONGOING) - The Energy project, identified and started in Spring 2021, is an interactive minigame designed to teach children about the types of energy that go into powering our society.</p>
						<img src="images/fulls/energy-main.jpg" class="image fit" alt="" />
						<p>As the team design lead, I'm currently collaborating with my team of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering students to design this minigame for our community partner CISTAR, an NSF Engineering Center. I'm responsible for the CAD design of power plant "chess pieces," which are the main component that children get to touch and interact with.</p>
						<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Design for manufacturability</li>
								<li>Part strength, safety, and longevity</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<h4>Design for Manufacturability</h4>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/energy-printed.jpg" alt="" /></span>Past project experience with manufacturability concerns led me to prioritize this design consideration: I kept in mind the 3D printability of each chess piece throughout concept generation and detailed design stages, and made sure that each piece can either be printed without extra support material or easily split into pieces that can be done so. This not only improves the surface finish of each part, but also means we create the least plastic waste we can!</p>
						<h4>Part strength, safety, and longevity</h4>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/energy-hsinsert.jpg" alt="Image showing the bottom half of a chess piece, with heat-set inserts fitted in" /></span>Because these pieces are the main components that children will get their hands on and play with, they need to be robust and cannot snap off into choking hazards.<br>
						To accomodate magnets that activate the electrical circuit that make up the heart of the minnigame, the chess pieces have hollow bases. In order to keep the top and bottom halves separable for maintenance, I chose to implement "threaded heat-set inserts" to interface between the plastic part and metal screws, which ensure that the parts last with repeated fastening.</p>
						<p>In the next few months, our team aims to complete the prototyping of one "level" of the minigame.
